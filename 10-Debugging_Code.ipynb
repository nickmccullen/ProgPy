    "\n",
    "From: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubber duck debugging is an informal term used in software engineering for a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifying big equations (or compound Python statement) that don't do what you expect\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable, but\n",
    "they can be hard to debug. It is often a good idea to break a complex\n",
    "expression into a series of simpler lines containing temporary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Mean = {}\".format(sum(arrayname)/len(arrayname)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "is simpler to read as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sumvalues=sum(arrayname)\n",
    "N=len(arrayname)\n",
    "meanval=sumvalues/N\n",
    "meanstr = f\"Mean = {meanval}\"\n",
    "print(meanstr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem that can occur with big expressions is that the order of\n",
    "evaluation may not be what you expect. For example, if you are translating the\n",
    "expression ``x/2pi`` into Python, you might write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = x / 2 * math.pi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not correct because multiplication and division have the same\n",
    "precedence and are evaluated from left to right. So this expression computes\n",
    "``(x/2)pi``.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make the order of\n",
    "evaluation explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = x / (2 * math.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use brackets.  Not\n",
    "only will the program be correct (in the sense of doing what you intended), it\n",
    "will also be more readable for other people."

    "\n",

    "The error message tells you where in the program the Python noticed a problem.\n",
    "However, sometimes the real error is before to the location of\n",
    "the error message, often on the preceding line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are copying code from another example, start by comparing your code to the original very carefully. Check every character. At the same time, remember that the source code might be wrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it\n",
    "might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Make sure you do not use a built-in Python keyword or function for a variable name:\n",
    "    * e.g.: `for, sum, print,...` \n",
    "2. Check that you have a colon (`:`) before indented code blocks including after ``for``, ``while``, ``if``, and ``def`` statements.\n",
    "3. Check that indentation is consistent. You may indent with either spaces or\n",
    "   tabs but it's best not to mix them. Each level should be indented by the same\n",
    "   amount.\n",
    "4. Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks (E.g.: `\"Hello'` is wrong)\n",
    "    * If you have multiline strings with triple quotes, make\n",
    "   sure you have ended the string properly. \n",
    "    * A string that is not closed correctly may\n",
    "   cause an ``invalid token`` error at the end of your program, or it may treat\n",
    "   the following part of the program as a string until it comes to the next\n",
    "   string. \n",
    "       - In the second case, it might not produce an error message at all!\n",
    "6. An unclosed bracket --- (, {, or [ --- makes Python continue with the next\n",
    "   line as part of the current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost\n",
    "   immediately in the *next* line.\n",
    "7. Check for the classic ``=`` instead of ``==`` inside a conditional.\n",
    "    * `if a=0:` is incorrect; it should be `if a==0:`"
