    "The goal of these notes is to help you to learn how to program. We will\n",
    "be using the programming language Python, but you will be able to use\n",
    "the skills you learn here with other programming systems such as Matlab, R or C.  \n",
    "Coding will also develop your creative problem solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a very important and useful skill for an engineer. Almost\n",
    "any job these days requires interaction with computer systems and many\n",
    "will require some level of programming.\n",
    "Engineering companies increasingly want to employ people with programming\n",
    "abilities and the ability to automate tasks with program scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you learn here can be used in automation of processes,\n",
    "computation of complex problems, control of equipment, instrumentation\n",
    "for making measurements, data analysis and producing figures of results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language.\n",
    "It is free and open source and as such has many implemetations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically type *commands* into a command window, code-block or script file, then run them.\n",
    "The *Python interpreter* reads the programme commands you give it and runs them to produce an output."

    "## Why Use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is good to learn how to program because it has a clear structure\n",
    "and syntax compared to many programming languages.  \n",
    "It is easy to \n",
    "use it to get started with basic programming and from there it is possible to\n",
    "gradually teach yourself how to do much more advanced programming. \n",

    "## How To Use These Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the most of these notes it is important that you read through\n",
    "each section,  \n",
    "***enter and actually do*** all the examples and attempt the\n",
    "problems in the course Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to return to earlier section as you work your way through.  \n",
    "Make your own notes, especially when you get stuck or something is not clear.  \n",
    "This will be helpful when you return to a problem later and also when\n",
    "you have questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "-   Try to predict what the output will be before running the examples.\n",
    "    You should try to think through the steps of how the computer works through\n",
    "    your programs.\n",
    "-   It is often useful to work out some ideas with pen and paper before\n",
    "    you start entering code.\n",
    "-   Test your code. Always try a simple version of your program on examples where\n",
    "    you know what the coutcome should be.\n",
    "-   Ask questions to yourself such as:\n",
    "    -   \"What would happen if I tried this?\"\n",
    "    -   \"Are there any input values for which the program does not work\n",
    "        or gives the wrong answer?\"\n",
    "    -   \"Will someone else be able to understand the code I have just\n",
    "        written?\"\n",
    "    -   \"Will I be able to understand this code in a few weeks time?\"\n",
    "- Finally **experiment!** Instead of asking _\"what will happen if...?\"_ or _\"will this work?\"_ , just try it and see what happens. You are unlikely to break the computer by trying something out!"

    "    are reported by error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Runtime errors**: these will be detected when the program is run. An\n",
    "    example of a runtime error would be attempting to divide by zero or\n",
    "    attempting to read from a file that does not exist. Add a line\n",
    "    `print(1/0)` add the end of the example program and run it again.\n",
    "    Note that the symbol `/` denotes division. Runtime errors are\n",
    "    reported by error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Logical errors**: these are errors that cause the program to run but\n",
    "    give the wrong result. Logical errors will not necessarily cause the\n",
    "    program to stop with an error message. A very basic logical error in\n",
